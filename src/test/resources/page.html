        A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">Web crawler</a>, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler,
        is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).
        Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or
        indices of others sites' web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine which indexes
        the downloaded pages so users can search more efficiently.

        Crawlers consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites without approval. Issues of schedule, load,
        and "politeness" come into play when large collections of pages are accessed. Mechanisms exist for public sites
        not wishing to be crawled to make this known to the crawling agent.
        For example, including a robots.txt file can request bots to index only parts of a website, or nothing at all.
        The number of Internet pages is extremely large; even the largest crawlers fall short of making a complete index.
        For this reason, search engines struggled to give relevant search results in the early years of the World Wide Web,
        before 2000. Today, relevant results are given almost instantly.
        Crawlers can validate hyperlinks and HTML code. They can also be used for web scraping (see also data-driven programming).
